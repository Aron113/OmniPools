## Description
OmniPools is a decentralised forum-style crowdfunding platform utilising fractional investing technology, where experienced investors can compile NFTs that they deem valuable. 

Here, we aim to break down the barriers of entry to NFT investment by leveraging fractional investment technology.
At the same time, OmniPools aims to curate a marketplace of high value NFTs through the use of a DAO incentive system.
