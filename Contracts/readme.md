# Contracts
## Fractionlisation
Our DAO uses the ERC 721 Vault Factory to fractionalise ERC721s and mint ERC20s. The Vault Factory deploys a new vault contract that stores our NFT and mints ERC20 tokens which are transferred to the DAO's wallet.
## CrowdFunding
The CrowdFunding contract acts as a Project contract factory. Proposers instantiate a new Project contract whenever they submit a proposal.
